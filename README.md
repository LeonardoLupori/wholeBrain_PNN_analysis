# wholeBrain_PNN_analysis

Analysis code to reproduce all figures of the paper _A Comprehensive Atlas of Perineuronal Net Distribution and Colocalization with Parvalbumin in the Adult Mouse Brain_

## Dependencies

To run the scripts in this repository you will need:

1. To download preprocessed data
2. To install the correct version of Python and additional packages

### Download preprocessed data

In order to run the analysis code you will need to download a set of preprocessed data. You can find the data files in the latest release under the _assets_ menu.

> **Please Note**  
> If you want to dowload all the **raw** microscopy data that are related to this paper, you can download the entire dataset on Zenodo at XXX.

### Python Environment

To run most of the scripts in this repository you will need python 3.7 and the correct version of several additional packages. You can easily install everything in a new vistual environment using anaconda.

To do this, use the following command:

``` conda
conda create -n pnnWholeBrain --file requirements.txt
```

> **Please Note**  
> Due to a Python version incompatibility, the three notebooks that generate renders of coronally sliced heatmaps of the brain with [brainrender](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainrender) and [bg-heatmaps](https://github.com/brainglobe/bg-heatmaps) cannot be run with the same environment.  
> For this reason, you should prepare the data for rendering using the appropriate notebook and then run the brainRender notebooks using a different (Python 3.8) environment.  
> You can install the brainRender environment with:  
>
> ```
> conda create -n brainRender --file requirements_brainrender.txt
> ```

## **wholebrain_tools package**

Analysis in this work were conducted with the help of custom code wrapped in a python package. This package contains the following modules:

- **aba**: handling of the Allen Brain Atlas
- **stats**: tools for statistical analysis
- **graphics**: tools for custom plots
- **dataIO**: file handling

Note, the repository contains a **path.ini** configuration file, which is used to parse user-specified paths to the various functions in the notebooks, making collaborative programming easier. These paths are specified in the `path.ini` file and read by the pathParser object in the dataIO module. They are then assigned to dedicated variables. Alternatively, paths can be assigned directly to these variables rather than being specified in the `path.ini` file.
