# wholeBrain_PNN_analysis
Analysis code to reproduce all figures of the paper _A Comprehensive Atlas of Perineuronal Net Distribution and Colocalization with Parvalbumin in the Adult Mouse Brain_, published in [journal name]() <or in bioRxiv>


### Dependencies

To run the scripts in this repository you will need two conda environments.
- An environment with the packages listed in requirements.txt (python version: 3.6 or 3.7)
- An environment with the packages listed in requirements_brainrender.txt

The second environment is needed only for the renderings of brain slices, realised through [brainrender](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainrender) and [bg-heatmaps](https://github.com/brainglobe/bg-heatmaps)

Thus, unless otherwise stated, run the code in the first environment.

## **wholebrain_tools package**
---
Analysis in this work were conducted with the help of custom code wrapped in a python package. This package contains the following modules:
- **aba**: handling of the Allen Brain Atlas 
- **stats**: tools for statistical analysis
- **graphics**: tools for custom plots
- **dataIO**: file handling

Importantly, the repository contains a path.ini.
