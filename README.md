# wholeBrain_PNN_analysis

Analysis code to reproduce all figures of the paper [_A Comprehensive Atlas of Perineuronal Net Distribution and Colocalization with Parvalbumin in the Adult Mouse Brain_](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(23)00799-4)

## Dependencies

To run the scripts in this repository you will need:

1. To download preprocessed data
2. To install the correct version of Python and additional packages

### Download preprocessed data

In order to run the analysis code you will need to download a set of preprocessed data. You can find the data files in the latest release under the _assets_ menu at this [link](https://github.com/LeonardoLupori/wholeBrain_PNN_analysis/releases/latest)

> **Please Note**  
> If you want to download all the **raw** microscopy data that are related to this paper, you can download the entire dataset on Zenodo [HERE](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7419283).

### Python Environment

To run the scripts in this repository you will need python 3.8 and the correct version of several additional packages. You can easily install everything in a new virtual environment using anaconda.

To do this, use the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n pnnWholeBrain python==3.8
```

Then activate the environment and install all the required packages

```bash
conda activate pnnWholeBrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## The paths.ini file

The repository contains a `paths.ini` configuration file, which is used to parse user-specified paths to the various functions in the notebooks, making collaborative programming easier. These paths are specified in the `paths.ini` file and read by the pathParser object in the dataIO module. They are then assigned to dedicated variables. Alternatively, paths can be assigned directly to these variables rather than being specified in the `paths.ini` file.

To run the notebooks download the `DATA` folder from the assets of this repo and manually put the full path of all the requested files and folders in the `paths.ini` file.

## wholebrain_tools package

- **graphics**: tools for custom plots
- **dataIO**: file handling
- **background**: functions to analyze the control dataset
- **pvnegative**: function to analyze the energy of a subset of PNNs (PV<sup>-</sup>)
